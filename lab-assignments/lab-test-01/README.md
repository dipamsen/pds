# Lab Test 1 (PDS Lab, Section 3, Autumn 2024)

The lab test had two sets of question papers, one for even roll numbers and the other for odd roll numbers. Questions and solutions to both are available in respective directories.

Note: In the test, I have solved the odd question paper, so solutions in `odd` are exactly what I wrote in the test. Since `even` questions are very similar, the solutions in `even` are slightly modified versions of my odd solutions.
