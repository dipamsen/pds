# Lab Assignments

My solutions to PDS Lab Assignments - Autumn 2024 Session, Section 3.

- `Asgn{n}.pdf` has the problem statements for the assignment
- `1.c`, `2.c`, `3.c`, ... are the solutions to problems 1, 2, 3, ... respectively
- `eval.txt` has evaluation information (marks obtained, mistakes)
