Marks for Problem 2.c: 24/30

- The number of iterations should also be calculated.
- To print the result up to n decimal places, use: printf("%.*f (computed in %d iterations)\n", n, ...).
- Ensure that the loop breaks when there is no change in value up to n decimal places between two consecutive iterations.
